# My custom chess engine in C#!
Current functionalities:
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Piece-square heat maps
- Book moves using Polyglot book format and Zobrist hashing. "Cerebellum3Merge.bin" for engine-curated moves and "Human.bin" for fun, unorthodox openings.

TODO:
- Killer move heuristic
- Check extensions
- Quiescence search
- Blended endgame tables
- Passed pawn detection
